        <p>The circular economy is an economic system aimed at minimizing waste and making the most of resources. This system is regenerative by design and aims to keep products, components, and materials at their highest utility and value at all times.</p>
        <p>By supporting the circular economy, we can reduce environmental impact and foster sustainable development for future generations.</p>
